# Welcome to the Mediastream Android SDK

Hello, Android Developer! 👋

Welcome to the Mediastream SDK for Android, designed to streamline the integration of our powerful features into your applications. This SDK provides access to advanced Mediastream capabilities, allowing you to deliver exceptional multimedia experiences to your users.

## Version
- **Version:** The current version of the SDK is b9.1.0.
- **Compatibility:** Compatible with Android API level 34 (Android 14)

## Adding Mediastream Platform SDK to Your Android Project

To integrate the Mediastream Platform SDK into your Android project, add the following dependency to your project's build.gradle file:

```gradle
implementation "io.github.mediastream:mediastreamplatformsdkandroid:b9.1.0"
```

### Basic Implementation

In this minimal setup, the SDK takes care of various intricate processes, leveraging the provided account ID, content ID, and content type to ensure a seamless experience. This simplicity enables you to focus on creating engaging applications without the need for extensive configurations.

### Activity
```android
import am.mediastre.mediastreamplatformsdkandroid.MediastreamPlayer
import am.mediastre.mediastreamplatformsdkandroid.MediastreamPlayerConfig

class VideoActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var container: FrameLayout
    private lateinit var playerView: PlayerView
    private var player: MediastreamPlayer? = null

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
      super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
      setContentView(R.layout.activity_videoplayer)
      val config = MediastreamPlayerConfig()
      config.accountID = "PLATFORM_ACCOUNT_ID"
      config.id = "CONTENT_ID"
      config.type = MediastreamPlayerConfig.VideoTypes.VOD
      playerView = findViewById(R.id.player_view)
      container = findViewById(R.id.main_media_frame)
      player = MediastreamPlayer(this, config, container, playerView)
    }
}
```

### Layout
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <FrameLayout
        android:id="@+id/main_media_frame"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:layout_weight="0.5"
        android:background="#000000"
        android:keepScreenOn="true">
        <androidx.media3.ui.PlayerView
            android:id="@+id/player_view"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent">
        </androidx.media3.ui.PlayerView>

        <fragment
            android:id="@+id/castMiniController"
            class="com.google.android.gms.cast.framework.media.widget.MiniControllerFragment"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_gravity="bottom"
            android:visibility="gone"
            android:layout_marginBottom="70dp"/>
    </FrameLayout>

</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

# MediastreamPlayerConfig: Customizing Your Playback Experience

The `MediastreamPlayerConfig` class in the Mediastream Android SDK provides a range of properties for tailoring and enhancing your playback experience. Here's an overview of the current properties:

# Implementing Event Handling with `MediastreamPlayerCallback`

The `MediastreamPlayerCallback` interface in the Mediastream SDK serves as the contract for handling various player events. By implementing this interface, you can listen to and respond to different states and actions during playback. Here's how you can use it:

```java
import com.mediastream.MediastreamPlayerCallback;

public class YourPlayerCallback implements MediastreamPlayerCallback {

    @Override
    public void onEnd() {
        // Called when the current video has completed playback to the end.
    }

    @Override
    public void onError() {
        // Called when an error not related to playback occurs.
    }

    @Override
    public void onPause() {
        // Called when the current video pauses playback.
    }

    // Implement other methods based on your event handling needs...

}
```

In your activity or fragment, set an instance of this callback to your Mediastream instance:

```android
MediastreamPlayerCallback playerCallback = new YourPlayerCallback();
Mediastream.addPlayerCallback(playerCallback);
```

# Event Listening in Mediastream SDK

The Mediastream SDK allows you to listen to various events emitted by the player, providing valuable hooks into the playback lifecycle. Here are the available events:

1. **`onEnd():`**
   - Called when the current video has completed playback to the end of the video.

2. **`onError():`**
   - Called when an error not related to playback occurs.

3. **`onPause():`**
   - Called when the current video pauses playback.

4. **`onPlay():`**
   - Called when the current video starts playing from the beginning.

5. **`onReady():`**
   - Called when the current video resumes playing from a paused state.

6. **`onNewSourceAdded():`**
   - Called when new settings are set.

7. **`onLocalSourceAdded():`**
   - Called when a local source is set.

8. **`onAdPlay():`**
    - Called when an Ad starts to play.

9. **`onAdPause():`**
    - Called when an Ad is paused.

10. **`onAdLoaded():`**
    - Called when an Ad is loaded.

11. **`onAdResume():`**
    - Called when an Ad is in resume mode.

12. **`onAdEnded():`**
    - Called when an Ad finishes.

13. **`onAdError():`**
    - Called when an Ad fails.

14. **`onAdSkipped():`**
    - Called when an Ad is skipped.

15. **`onAdSkippableStateChanged():`**
    - Called when the skippable state of an Ad changes.

16. **`onPlaybackErrors(JsonObject error):`**
    - Called when a playback error occurs.

17. **`onEmbedErrors(JsonObject error):`**
    - Called when an embed error occurs.

28. **`onLiveAudioCurrentSongChanged(JsonObject data):`**
