# Welcome to the Mediastream Apple SDK

Hello, Apple Developer! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Mediastream SDK for iOS and Apple TV, designed to streamline the integration of our powerful features into your applications. This SDK provides access to advanced Mediastream capabilities, allowing you to deliver exceptional multimedia experiences to your users.

## Version iOS
- **Version:** The current version of the SDK is 2.0.2.
- **Compatibility:** Compatible with Swift Version > 5.9

## Version Apple TV
- **Version:** The current version of the SDK is 0.1.3.
- **Compatibility:** Compatible with Swift Version > 5.6


## Adding Mediastream Platform SDK to Your iOS Project

To integrate the Mediastream Platform SDK into your Android project, add the following dependency to your project's pod file:

```swift
pod 'MediastreamPlatformSDKxC', '~> 2.0.2'
```

## Adding Mediastream Platform SDK to Your Apple TV Project

To integrate the Mediastream Platform SDK into your Android project, add the following dependency to your project's pod file:

```swift
pod 'MediastreamPlatformSDKAppleTV', '~> 0.1.3'
```


### Basic Implementation

In this minimal setup, the SDK takes care of various intricate processes, leveraging the provided account ID, content ID, and content type to ensure a seamless experience. This simplicity enables you to focus on creating engaging applications without the need for extensive configurations.

First at all, don't forget to select "YES" in "Allow Arbitrary Loads", which is inside the "App Transport Security" property. Also, allow "Required Background mode" by selecting the option as in the image.

### View
```swift
import UIKit
import MediastreamPlatformSDK

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        let playerConfig = MediastreamPlayerConfig()
        let mdstrm = MediastreamPlatformSDK()

        playerConfig.accountID = "ACCOUNT_ID"
        playerConfig.id = "CONTENT_ID"
        playerConfig.type = MediastreamPlayerConfig.VideoTypes.VOD

        self.addChildViewController(mdstrm)
        self.view.addSubview(mdstrm.view)

        mdstrm.setup(playerConfig)
        mdstrm.play()
    }

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
        // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
    }
}
```
# MediastreamPlayerConfig: Customizing Your Playback Experience

The `MediastreamPlayerConfig` class in the Mediastream iOS|Apple TV SDK provides a range of properties for tailoring and enhancing your playback experience. Here's an overview of the current properties:

## **Required Parameters:**

- **`id` (String):** Video, Audio, Live or Episode ID. You can get it from Mediastream Platform.
- **`accountID` (String):** Account ID. You can get it from Mediastream Platform.
- **`type` (MediastreamPlayerConfig.VideoTypes):** Video type. Possible values: VOD, LIVE, EPISODE. Tells the player what type of content is going to be played.

## **Optional Parameters:**

- **`adUrl` (String):** AdURL (e.g., VAST). If not specified, will play ads configured in the Mediastream Platform.
- **`accessToken` (String):** Access token for restricted videos.
- **`autoplay` (boolean):** Autoplay video if true. Default: false.
- **`videoFormat` (MediastreamPlayerConfig.AudioVideoFormat):** Type of video (e.g., HLS). Possible values: HLS, M4A. Default: HLS.
- **`dvr` (boolean):** Player starts prepared to use DVR. Default: false.
- **`windowDVR` (int):** Window DVR voiced in seconds.
- **`showControls` (boolean):** Hide the controls of the player. Default: true.
- **`referer` (string):** Allows setting a custom referrer for statistics.
- **`src` (string):** Arbitrary source to reproduce.
- **`loadNextAutomatically` (boolean):** Allows playing the next episode if it exists. Available only when the EPISODE type is set. Default: false.
- **`appName` (string):** Very useful to identify traffic in platform analytics. Example: "mediastream-app-tv" or "mediastream-app-mobile".
- **`playerId` (String):** Takes player configuration from platform settings.
- **`tryToGetMetadataFromLiveWhenAudio` (boolean):** If your live content contains TPE1 and TIT2 tags on the manifest, this metadata will be parsed and sent on `onLiveAudioCurrentSongChanged` event. Default: true.
- **`googleImaPPID` (String):** Allows to set PPID (Publisher Provided Identification) to IMA SDK.

# Implementing Event Handling with `MediastreamPlayerCallback`

The `MediastreamPlayerCallback` interface in the Mediastream SDK serves as the contract for handling various player events. By implementing this interface, you can listen to and respond to different states and actions during playback. Here's how you can use it:

```swift
let mdstrm = MediastreamPlatformSDK()

mdstrm.events.listenTo(eventName: "play", action: {
    NSLog("Player is playing")
})

mdstrm.events.listenTo(eventName: "pause", action: {
    NSLog("Player is paused")
})

mdstrm.events.listenTo(eventName: "error", action: { (information: Any?) in
    if (information != nil) {
        if let info = information as? String {
            NSLog("ERROR: \(info)")
        }
    }
})
```

# Event Listening in Mediastream SDK

The Mediastream SDK allows you to listen to various events emitted by the player, providing valuable hooks into the playback lifecycle. Here are the available events:

1. **`finish:`**
   - Called when the current video has completed playback to the end of the video.

2. **`error:`**
   - Called when an error not related to playback occurs.

3. **`pause:`**
   - Called when the current video pauses playback.

4. **`play:`**
   - Called when the current video starts playing from the beginning.

5. **`ready:`**
   - Called when the current video resumes playing from a paused state.

6. **`onAdPlay:`**
    - Called when an Ad starts to play.

7. **`onAdPause:`**
    - Called when an Ad is paused.

8. **`onAdLoaded:`**
    - Called when an Ad is loaded.

9. **`onAdResume:`**
    - Called when an Ad is in resume mode.

10. **`onAdEnded:`**
    - Called when an Ad finishes.

11. **`onAdError:`**
    - Called when an Ad fails.

12. **`onAdSkipped:`**
    - Called when an Ad is skipped.

13. **`conectionStablished:`**
    - Called whenever the SDK is connected to internet.

14. **`conectionLost:`**
    - Called whenever the SDK lost internet connection.

15. **`seek:`**
    - Called when the user is seeking.


These events allow you to respond dynamically to various states and actions during playback.

# Examples
